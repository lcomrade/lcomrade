# Give Up GitHub!
I've started to slowly leave GitHub.
I am in the process of moving my Git repositories to my own server at https://git.lcomrade.su/root

I did so because I want to take away Microsoft's power over open source projects.
Yes, GitHub together with Microsoft provides a great environment for free software developers, but I am willing to sacrifice convenience for freedom.
But keep in mind that Microsoft is first and foremost an American capitalist company which creates closed source software and watches over its users.

You should do the same.
If you don't have your own server, you can use a public server based on free software. Here is a list:
| Instance      | Uses      |
|---------------|-----------|
| codeberg.org  | Gitea     |
| notabug.org   | Gogs      |
| sourcehut.org | Sourcehut |
